All the dependencies and build settings you need to get started
with React and Trails, in one place.

## Usage
```config/webpack``` has a prebuilt webpack template for use
with modern React frontends. To add custom settings or 
override these defaults, simply write your new settings into
your trails app's config/webpack.

## Dependencies
This trailpack uses a few Babel plugins that we find to be
useful for React development.

## TODO
HMR with Hapi, Express, Koa
